<p>I am currently a Ph.D. student co-advised by Prof. <a href="http://rcv.kaist.ac.kr/" target="_blank">In So Kweon</a> and Prof. <a href="https://siit.kaist.ac.kr/" target="_blank">Junmo Kim</a> at <a href="https://kaist.ac.kr/en/" target="_blank">KAIST</a>. My research aims to effectively train deep neural networks under limited labels and data, such as long-tailed/biased labels and unlabeled data. Also, I have a broad interest in techniques for learning general representations and improving modelâ€™s robustness to distribution shifts, such as uni-/multi-modal representation learning, domain generalization, etc.
