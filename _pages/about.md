<p>I am a Ph.D. student co-advised by Prof. <a href="http://rcv.kaist.ac.kr/" target="_blank">In So Kweon</a> and Prof. <a href="https://siit.kaist.ac.kr/" target="_blank">Junmo Kim</a> at <a href="https://kaist.ac.kr/en/" target="_blank">KAIST</a>, and am currently working as a research intern at <a href="https://www.lgresearch.ai/" target="_blank">LG AI Reseach</a>.

<p>My research interest aims to build robust recognition system for image and video understanding under limited and/or biased data. Towards this goal, I have been working on data-efficient learning techniques in image and video domain. In addition, I have interest in vision and language models, specifically for enhancing visual understanding tasks.
