<p>I am currently a Ph.D. student co-advised by Prof. <a href="http://rcv.kaist.ac.kr/" target="_blank">In So Kweon</a> and Prof. <a href="https://siit.kaist.ac.kr/" target="_blank">Junmo Kim</a>, in <a href="https://ee.kaist.ac.kr/en/" target="_blank">Electrical Engineering</a> at <a href="https://kaist.ac.kr/en/" target="_blank">Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)</a>. 
Previously, I earned my M.S. in <a href="https://ee.kaist.ac.kr/en/" target="_blank">Electrical Engineering</a> from <a href="https://kaist.ac.kr/en/" target="_blank">KAIST</a> (Feb. 2021) and B.S. in <a href="https://ee.korea.ac.kr/eng/main/main.html" target="_blank">Electrical Engineering</a> from <a href="https://www.korea.edu/mbshome/mbs/en/index.do" target="_blank">Korea University</a> (Feb. 2019). </p>

<p>My research focuses on data-hungry problems (e.g., semi-supervised learning) and bias in data labels (e.g., class-imbalance) for deep neural networks. 
I also have a broad interest in learning general representations (e.g., self-supervised learning) and improving model's robustness to distribution shifts (e.g., domain generalization).</p>
