<p>I am a Ph.D. student advised by Prof. <a href="http://rcv.kaist.ac.kr/" target="_blank">In So Kweon</a> and Prof. <a href="https://siit.kaist.ac.kr/" target="_blank">Junmo Kim</a> at <a href="https://kaist.ac.kr/en/" target="_blank">KAIST</a>, and was a research intern at <a href="https://www.lgresearch.ai/" target="_blank">LG AI Reseach</a>, working with Dr. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-__ECRsAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Pyunghwan Ahn</a> and Dr. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HPd_1LMAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Jinhyung Kim</a>.

<p>My research centers on developing data-efficient and robust recognition systems that address limitations and biases in image and video data. I am currently focusing on enhancing vision-language models to improve compositional reasoning and multi-modal understanding for more robust and comprehensive recognition systems.
